## Calgary-PMF
This repository is for creating a spatial map of source contributions from PMF. This task is specifically for Calgary and using PMF to find sources of VOCs. 
Here we are plotting a heat map that represents factor contribution. We also added a map using circle markers to see hotspots in the area.
